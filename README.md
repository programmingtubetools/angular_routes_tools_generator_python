Python tools that generates links for menu and routes for application page for Angular

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I created a python script that automatically generates page name and link for menu and also generates routes for your web pages. The route consist of title and subtitle along with your ComponentName that can be modified.

##Steps

- Open the python script
- Create a .txt file having page name per line. Provide in tool without ext. name (eg. filename: link.txt -> link)
- Provide component name to the script
- You will get two file named tools, routes resp.
